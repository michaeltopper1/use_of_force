Notes on cleaning Louisville:
* For the shifts, I needed to floor_date the shifts to be hours instead of minutes. Hence a shift that starts at
8:30 will be registered at 8. This only affected 11k of 2.7 million shifts when I did a comparison. This
shouldn't be an issue and the graphs look similar. This is only done to be able to match better.
