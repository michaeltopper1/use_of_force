Notes on cleaning Louisville:
* Cleaning Shifts
 + combined any shifts that ended and started at the same time. For instance, if a shift went from 10-12 and another went from 12-3, the shift would be 10-3.
 + if there are two shifts that are overlapping, I first take the longer of the two shifts. This is to ensure that if there is a 10 hour shift and a 1 hour shift overlapping, the 10 hour shift takes precedent. If this does not work, and the shifts are the same length (e.g., 10 hour and 10 hour), I take the shift that is the latest in startdate of the two. This is due to the fact that this was probably updated later on in the day or retroactively.
 + after merging, 3160/3478 of the unique use of force reports (90.8%) were merged to a shift
 + the remaining 9% will have some summary stats made about them
