# cleaning shifts data ----------------------------------------------------

      janitor::clean_names() %>% mutate(badge = as.character(badge)))

## looks like i put the floor_date to hours. Shifts start on the hour and end on the hour
shifts <- shifts %>% 
  mutate(start_date = floor_date(startdate, unit = "hours"),
         end_date = floor_date(enddate, unit = "hours"),
         shift_length = seconds(end_date - start_date)) %>%

# cleaning officer demographics -------------------------------------------

## this is the updated police demographics from august 2022- it has more information on gender and race of officer
officers <- read_csv("raw_data/louisville/police_demographics/demographics_aug2022.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(badge = aoc_code) %>% 
  mutate(badge = as.character(badge))

## this is the old officer information. however, it contains useful information such as the first/last name and education
## this information should be current through 2021
officers_old <- readxl::read_excel("raw_data/louisville/police_demographics/demographics_louisville.xlsx")

officers_old <- officers_old %>% 
  mutate(across(c(appointdate, dateoftermination), ~lubridate::ymd(.))) %>% 
  rename("appoint_date" = appointdate, "termination_date" = dateoftermination,
         "first_name" = fname, "last_name" = lname, "education_level" = educationlevel)



# joining the old and new officers ----------------------------------------

## bringing together the old and new officer information.
officers <- officers %>% 
  left_join(officers_old)


## shows that there is 1 duplicates
officers <- officers %>% 
  distinct() 


# merging with shifts data ------------------------------------------------
## apears there are an additional 11 rows that are added where there are multiple matches..negligible in my opinion - investigate
shifts <- shifts %>% 
  distinct() %>% ## removes duplicate shifts
  left_join(officers, by = c("badge"))


# creating additional necessary columns -----------------------------------
## experience will be age at jan 1, 2020
## education will be the highest level of educational attainment split by college, some college, high school, graduate, n
shifts <- shifts %>% 
  mutate(start_hour = hour(startdate), end_hour = hour(enddate)) %>% 
  extract(education_level, "education_level_letter", "(^[A-Z])", remove = F) %>% 
  mutate(college = ifelse(education_level_letter == "G", 1, 0),
         some_college = ifelse(education_level_letter == "F" | education_level_letter == "D" | education_level_letter == "H", 1,0),
         graduate_degree = ifelse(education_level_letter == "I" | education_level_letter == "K", 1, 0),
         high_school_grad = ifelse(education_level_letter == "C" | education_level_letter == "E",1 ,0), 
         unknown_schooling = ifelse(education_level_letter == "A" | is.na(education_level_letter),1, 0)) 

## creating a division column and filtering to only shifts 2010 and beyond
shifts <- shifts %>% 
  mutate(assignment = str_to_lower(assignment)) %>% 
  extract(assignment, "division", "(^\\d..)", remove = F) %>% 
  filter(shift_year >= 2010)  %>% 
  mutate(shift_start_year = lubridate::year(startdate))
  
## saving as csv
shifts %>% 
  write_csv(file = here::here("created_data/louisville/shifts_demographics.csv"))
